## Major Policy Changes Overview

### 🆕 Key New Additions in 2025

#### LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution) - New Implementation
Windows Server 2025 replaces legacy AdmPwd with modern LAPS:

- Password complexity and length controls
- Backup directory configuration  
- Encryption and expiration protection
- Post-authentication actions

#### Enhanced Windows Defender Protection
- Behavioral network blocks for brute force and ransomware protection
- Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules for comprehensive threat mitigation
- Improved real-time protection and scanning capabilities
- Enhanced exclusion management

#### Network Security Enhancements
- SMB encryption requirements and dialect restrictions
- Enhanced printer security with RPC authentication
- DNS security improvements (mDNS, NetBIOS controls)
- Comprehensive privilege rights assignments

#### Modern Application Controls
- AppInstaller restrictions to prevent unauthorized software
- Cloud content restrictions for enhanced security
- PowerShell transcription for audit compliance

### 🗑️ Notable Removals in 2025

#### Legacy Components Deprecated
- **Old LAPS (AdmPwd):** Completely replaced with native Windows LAPS
- **DNS over HTTPS policies:** Simplified DNS security approach
- **Legacy firewall configurations:** Streamlined for modern networks
- **Cortana and search features:** Enhanced privacy focus

### 🔄 Modified Configurations

#### Event Log Optimization
- **Reduced log sizes** for better performance:
  - Application/Setup/System: 4GB → 32MB
  - Security: 4GB → 192MB

#### Enhanced Security Controls
- **Terminal Services:** Reduced idle timeout (1 hour → 15 minutes)
- **Network Paths:** Added privacy requirements to NETLOGON/SYSVOL
- **PowerShell:** Enabled transcription for compliance
- **Account Lockout:** Changed from success/failure to failure-only auditing

## Implementation Recommendations

### Migration Strategy
1. **Test Environment Deployment:** Validate 158 new policies in staging
2. **Phased Rollout:** Implement critical security policies first
3. **Training Requirements:** Update staff on new LAPS and Defender features
4. **Compliance Updates:** Incorporate new audit and logging requirements

### Priority Areas
- **Immediate:** Deploy enhanced privilege rights and LAPS configuration
- **Short-term:** Implement Windows Defender behavioral protections
- **Medium-term:** Update network security and printer protection policies
- **Long-term:** Full migration to 2025 CIS L2 baseline
